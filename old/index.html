<h1>Ranked-ballot voting methods</h1>
<p>
Ranked ballots allow a voter to express relative preferences among candidates.&nbsp; For example, a ranked ballot of
<span class="cand">A&gt;B&gt;C</span> indicates that the voter prefers candidate A to candidate B, candidate B to candidate C and (thus)
candidate A to candidate C.
</p><p>
Here I describe and compare several methods of choosing a single winner given a collection of ranked ballots.&nbsp; The methods vary in
their ability to choose a candidate with broad appeal (to satify &ldquo;social utility&rdquo;) and to resist strategically insincere
voting.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, no ranked-ballot voting method is entirely resistant to such insincerity, unlike better and simpler systems
such as <a href="https://www.electionscience.org/">Approval Voting</a>.)
</p><p>
I never quite got around to finishing this project to my satisfaction&mdash;it&rsquo;s still a work in progress&mdash;but please browse
around, see what you think, and e-mail any comments, criticisms, or suggestions to
<span class="email">rlegrand@</span><span class="email">angelo.edu</span>.&nbsp; The ranked-ballot voting calculator is especially
useful and fun to experiment with.
