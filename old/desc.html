<h1>Descriptions of ranked-ballot voting methods</h1>
<p>
These methods assume input of ranked ballots.&nbsp; The ballot <span class="cand">A&gt;B&gt;C</span> means the voter
prefers candidate <span class="cand">A</span> to candidate <span class="cand">B</span>, <span class="cand">B</span> to
<span class="cand">C</span> and <span class="cand">A</span> to <span class="cand">C</span>.&nbsp; The line
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">4:A&gt;B&gt;C</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
means four of that same ballot.&nbsp; Most of the methods allow input of tied preferences, which are shown using an
equals sign, so
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">3:A&gt;B=C&gt;D</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
means three voters like <span class="cand">A</span> most and <span class="cand">D</span> least, but have no preference
between <span class="cand">B</span> and <span class="cand">C</span>.
</p><p>
All of these methods rightly choose the majority winner when there are only two candidates, but they often differ when
there are three or more.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="borda">Borda</a></strong> is a point-count system.&nbsp; Each candidate is given a score equal to the
total number of times that candidate is ranked over another minus the total number of times that candidate is ranked
under another.&nbsp; For example, if there are 32 voters who vote
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">14:Alan&gt;Beth&gt;Carl</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">11:Beth&gt;Carl&gt;Alan</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">7:Carl&gt;Alan&gt;Beth</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
<span class="cand">Alan</span> is ranked over another candidate 35 times (21 over <span class="cand">Beth</span> and 14
over <span class="cand">Carl</span>) and under another candidate 29 times (11 under <span class="cand">Beth</span> and 18
under <span class="cand">Carl</span>), so his Borda score is 35 minus 29, or 6.  Similarly,
<span class="cand">Beth</span> receives a score of 8 (11+25-21-7) and <span class="cand">Carl</span> a score of -14
(18+7-14-25).&nbsp; (Equivalently, the following could be used: a candidate gets no points for a last-place vote, one
point for a second-to-last-place vote, on up to first place.)&nbsp; So Borda picks <span class="cand">Beth</span> in this
election.&nbsp; Borda is sometimes considered the best ranked-ballot method when voters are sincere, but it&rsquo;s
probably the most easily manipulated.&nbsp; It also fails to be independent of clones:&nbsp; Consider an election with
three candidates.&nbsp; <span class="cand">Eric</span> is right-wing and <span class="cand">Fran</span> and
<span class="cand">Gary</span> are left-wing.&nbsp; 63% of the voters are right-wing, 37% are left-wing and all of the
voters prefer <span class="cand">Fran</span> to <span class="cand">Gary</span> because of a scandal involving
<span class="cand">Gary</span>, so the sincere votes are
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">63:Eric&gt;Fran&gt;Gary</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">37:Fran&gt;Gary&gt;Eric</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
Borda gives the win to <span class="cand">Fran</span> even though <span class="cand">Eric</span> received a strong
majority of first-place votes and would have won handily if <span class="cand">Gary</span> hadn&rsquo;t run, showing that
parties have incentive to saturate an election with their candidates under Borda.&nbsp; <span class="cand">Fran</span>
and <span class="cand">Gary</span> are called clones in this election because they&rsquo;re next to each other on every
ballot.&nbsp; Clone-independent methods give the same results if a group of clones is replaced by one candidate; any
reasonable clone-independent method would choose <span class="cand">Eric</span> in this election, removing the
candidate-saturation incentive.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="nanson">Nanson</a></strong>, <strong><a name="baldwin">Baldwin</a></strong> and
<strong><a name="rouse">Rouse</a></strong> are recursive elimination methods that use Borda.&nbsp; At each step, Nanson
eliminates all candidates that have a negative Borda score, then calculates new Borda scores based on the uneliminated
candidates and repeats.&nbsp; Baldwin eliminates only the candidate with the single lowest Borda score before
recalculating.&nbsp; Rouse is like Baldwin with an extra step of recursion: it successively eliminates the candidate with
the <em>highest</em> Borda score until one is left, then it eliminates that candidate from the original list; this step
is repeated until one is left.&nbsp; For example, given the votes
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">14:Jana&gt;Kurt&gt;Lisa</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">7:Kurt&gt;Lisa&gt;Jana</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">11:Lisa&gt;Jana&gt;Kurt</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
Nanson would eliminate <span class="cand">Kurt</span> and <span class="cand">Lisa</span>, who have Borda scores of -8 and
-6, making <span class="cand">Jana</span> the winner.&nbsp; Baldwin would eliminate only <span class="cand">Kurt</span>
at first; recalculating the Borda scores without <span class="cand">Kurt</span> gives <span class="cand">Jana</span> -4
and <span class="cand">Lisa</span> 4, so <span class="cand">Lisa</span> would win.&nbsp; Rouse would excuse
<span class="cand">Jana</span> from being eliminated first since she has the best Borda score; without
<span class="cand">Jana</span>, <span class="cand">Kurt</span> would beat <span class="cand">Lisa</span> 10 to -10, so
<span class="cand">Lisa</span> would be eliminated first.&nbsp; With <span class="cand">Lisa</span> gone,
<span class="cand">Jana</span> and <span class="cand">Kurt</span> would have Borda scores of 18 and -18, so Rouse would
pick <span class="cand">Jana</span> as the winner.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="hare">Hare</a></strong>, <strong><a name="carey">Carey</a></strong> and
<strong><a name="coombs">Coombs</a></strong> are also elimination methods.&nbsp; Hare is the original name of the
infamous Instant Runoff Voting, which seems to many the most intuitive ranked-ballot extension of our current plurality
system.&nbsp; At first only the first-rank votes are counted.&nbsp; The candidate with the smallest first-rank total is
eliminated from the ballots, possibly adding to other candidates&rsquo; first-rank totals.&nbsp; This step is repeated
until a winner is left.&nbsp; Carey (a generalization of Craig Carey&rsquo;s three-candidate IFPP method) has a similar
approach, but instead of eliminating only one candidate per step, it eliminates all candidates with below-average
first-rank totals.&nbsp; Coombs is much like Hare in reverse:&nbsp; The candidate with the largest last-rank total is
eliminated.&nbsp; The last-rank totals are recalculated and the step repeated until only one remains.&nbsp; For example,
in the election
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">9:Katy&gt;Luke&gt;Mary</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">4:Luke&gt;Mary&gt;Katy</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">6:Mary&gt;Luke&gt;Katy</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
Hare eliminates <span class="cand">Luke</span> (with a first-rank total of 4) and chooses <span class="cand">Mary</span>
over <span class="cand">Katy</span> (10 to 9), while Carey eliminates both <span class="cand">Luke</span> and
<span class="cand">Mary</span> in the first step (since the average first-rank total is 6.333) and picks
<span class="cand">Katy</span>.&nbsp; Coombs eliminates <span class="cand">Katy</span> and chooses
<span class="cand">Luke</span> over <span class="cand">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Notice that under Hare, the
<span class="cand">Katy</span>-first voters are punished for voting sincerely; they could have prevented their last
choice from winning by insincerely voting <span class="cand">Luke&gt;Katy&gt;Mary</span> instead.&nbsp; Also, under
Carey, the <span class="cand">Luke</span>- and <span class="cand">Mary</span>-first voters are punished for voting
sincerely; they would be better served by deciding collectively which candidate to support, thus keeping
<span class="cand">Katy</span> from winning, much as in our current plurality system.&nbsp; Of all the methods, Hare,
Carey and Coombs consider the smallest amount of ballot information at any one time.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="bucklin">Bucklin</a></strong> tries to find a majority for some candidate by counting only the
first-place votes.&nbsp; If no candidate has a majority of votes, all second-place votes are included in the count, then
third-place, etc., until some candidate has more than half the number of voters.&nbsp; Consider the following election:
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">7:Mark&gt;Nell&gt;Owen</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">2:Nell&gt;Mark&gt;Owen</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">3:Owen&gt;Mark&gt;Nell</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">5:Owen&gt;Nell&gt;Mark</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
No candidate has a majority of first-place votes, so second-place votes are added to the counts and
<span class="cand">Nell</span> wins with 14 votes.&nbsp; Note that <span class="cand">Mark</span>&rsquo;s 12 votes also
constitute a majority at that point, but <span class="cand">Nell</span> is still the sole Bucklin winner (even though
<span class="cand">Mark</span> would have beaten <span class="cand">Nell</span> in a one-on-one race).
</p><hr><p>
Probably the most desirable property of a method is resistance to manipulation; as often as possible, the best strategic
vote should be a sincere vote.&nbsp; (Gibbard and Satterthwaite proved that no ranked-ballot method can be strategy-free
in all situations, but insincere voting can be made difficult.)&nbsp; The above methods are often easy for voters to
manipulate when there are more than two candidates, but with only two candidates the best voting strategy is always
sincere.&nbsp; This insight suggests a new approach: comparing candidates one-on-one, that is, treating the
multicandidate election as a series of two-candidate elections.&nbsp; The rest of the methods use a pairwise matrix,
calculated in one pass through the ranked ballots, that tells how often each candidate was ranked over each other
candidate (tied ranks are counted as half-votes for each side).&nbsp; For example, consider the following five-candidate
election:
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">98:Abby&gt;Cora&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">64:Brad&gt;Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Cora&gt;Dave</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">12:Brad&gt;Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">98:Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Abby&gt;Cora&gt;Dave</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">13:Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Abby&gt;Dave&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">125:Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Abby&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">124:Cora&gt;Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">76:Cora&gt;Erin&gt;Abby&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">21:Dave&gt;Abby&gt;Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">30:Dave&gt;Brad&gt;Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">98:Dave&gt;Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Cora&gt;Abby</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">139:Dave&gt;Cora&gt;Abby&gt;Brad&gt;Erin</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">23:Dave&gt;Cora&gt;Brad&gt;Abby&gt;Erin</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
The corresponding pairwise matrix is
</p><table border cellpadding=3>
<tr align="center"><td colspan=2 rowspan=2></td><th colspan=5>against</th></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="against">Abby</td><td class="against">Brad</td><td class="against">Cora</td><td class="against">Dave</td><td class="against">Erin</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><th rowspan=5>for</th><td class="for">Abby</td><td></td><td class="loss">458</td><td class="win">461</td><td class="win">485</td><td class="win">511</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="for">Brad</td><td class="win">463</td><td></td><td class="win">461</td><td class="loss">312</td><td class="win">623</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="for">Cora</td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="loss">460</td><td></td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="loss">460</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="for">Dave</td><td class="loss">436</td><td class="win">609</td><td class="win">461</td><td></td><td class="loss">311</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="for">Erin</td><td class="loss">410</td><td class="loss">298</td><td class="win">461</td><td class="win">610</td><td></td></tr>
</table><p>
So 609 voters preferred <span class="cand">Dave</span> to <span class="cand">Brad</span> and 312 preferred
<span class="cand">Brad</span> to <span class="cand">Dave</span>.&nbsp; (The winning total of each one-on-one matchup is
emphasized.)
</p><p>
Very often, there is a candidate who wins all of his one-on-one matchups, called the Condorcet winner.&nbsp; All of the
following pairwise methods (plus Nanson, Baldwin and Rouse from above) choose the Condorcet winner when one exists.&nbsp;
The example above has no Condorcet winner, and the following methods pick different winners.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="black">Black</a></strong> chooses the Condorcet winner when one exists and the Borda winner
otherwise.&nbsp; <span class="cand">Abby</span> would win the above election using Black since she is the Borda winner
and no Condorcet winner exists.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="copeland">Copeland</a></strong> counts pairwise victories for each candidate, counting a pairwise tie as
half a victory, and picks the candidate with the largest result.&nbsp; For the above example, Copeland would pick
<span class="cand">Abby</span> and <span class="cand">Brad</span> as winners, each with a score of 3.&nbsp; Copeland
ignores the relative strengths of the pairwise comparisons and is indecisive relatively often.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="small">Small</a></strong> calculates scores for the candidates exactly like Copeland.&nbsp; If more than
one candidate ties with the best Copeland score, the other candidates are eliminated and the scores are recalculated;
This step is repeated until no more candidates can be eliminated.&nbsp; In the above example,
<span class="cand">Abby</span> and <span class="cand">Brad</span> tie with a Copeland score of 3, so
<span class="cand">Cora</span>, <span class="cand">Dave</span> and <span class="cand">Erin</span> are eliminated, then
<span class="cand">Brad</span> wins over <span class="cand">Abby</span> 1 to 0.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="dodgson">Dodgson</a></strong> simply sums each candidate&rsquo;s margins of defeat and chooses the
candidate with the smallest sum.&nbsp; In a way, it picks the candidate &ldquo;closest&rdquo; to being a Condorcet
winner.&nbsp; The Dodgson winner for the above example is <span class="cand">Cora</span>, with a defeat-margin sum of
4.&nbsp; Notice that although <span class="cand">Cora</span> is a Condorcet loser, that is, she loses all of her
one-on-one matchups, she loses them by the smallest of margins.&nbsp; Dodgson can also be thought of as a sort of
compromise between Copeland and Simpson (below).
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="simpson">Simpson</a></strong> picks the candidate with the smallest maximum pairwise defeat.&nbsp; The
Simpson winner for the above example is also <span class="cand">Cora</span>; <span class="cand">Cora</span>&rsquo;s
largest defeat is by only one vote, and the other candidates have greater defeats.&nbsp; Simpson can be thought of as
successively ignoring the smallest defeat until one candidate is unbeaten.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="raynaud">Raynaud</a></strong> is an elimination method based on Simpson.&nbsp; The candidate with the
largest single pairwise defeat among remaining candidates is eliminated until only one remains.&nbsp; With her 623
defeat, <span class="cand">Erin</span> is the first to be eliminated in the example above; <span class="cand">Brad</span>
is next, then <span class="cand">Dave</span> and <span class="cand">Cora</span>, so <span class="cand">Abby</span> is the
winner.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="schulze">Schulze</a></strong> uses the concept of beatpaths to resolve pairwise cycles.&nbsp; A beatpath
is a sequence of pairwise victories linking one candidate to another.&nbsp;
<span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span> is an example from the above election; it&rsquo;s formed from the
victories <span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin</span>, <span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave</span> and
<span class="cand">Dave&gt;Brad</span>.&nbsp; Each beatpath has a strength equal to the strength of the weakest victory
it includes, so <span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span> has a strength of 511, the strength of the
<span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin</span> victory.&nbsp; For each pair of candidates, the strengths of the strongest
beatpaths each way are calculated:
</p><table border cellpadding=3>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span></td><td class="win">511</td><td class="loss">463</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Brad&gt;Abby</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Abby&gt;Cora</span></td><td class="win">461</td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Cora&gt;Abby</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave</span></td><td class="win">511</td><td class="loss">463</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Dave&gt;Brad&gt;Abby</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Abby&gt;Erin</span></td><td class="win">511</td><td class="loss">463</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad&gt;Abby</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Brad&gt;Cora</span></td><td class="win">461</td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Cora&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Brad&gt;Erin&gt;Dave</span></td><td class="win">610</td><td class="loss">609</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Dave&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="win"><span class="cand">Brad&gt;Erin</span></td><td class="win">623</td><td class="loss">609</td><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Brad</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Cora&gt;Dave</span></td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="win">461</td><td class="win"><span class="cand">Dave&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Cora&gt;Erin</span></td><td class="loss">460</td><td class="win">461</td><td class="win"><span class="cand">Erin&gt;Cora</span></td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td class="loss"><span class="cand">Dave&gt;Brad&gt;Erin</span></td><td class="loss">609</td><td class="win">610</td><td class="win"><span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
The candidate who always has a stronger beatpath to another than the other has to her, in this case
<span class="cand">Abby</span> (511-463 over <span class="cand">Brad</span>, <span class="cand">Dave</span> and
<span class="cand">Erin</span>, and 461-460 over <span class="cand">Cora</span>), is chosen as the Schulze winner.&nbsp;
Schulze usually agrees with Simpson, but Schulze avoids Simpson&rsquo;s paradoxical results as in this example.
</p><hr><p>
<strong><a name="tideman">Tideman</a></strong> orders the pairwise victories from strongest to weakest and locks them in
order, ignoring those that contradict stronger victories.&nbsp; In the above example, the
<span class="cand">Brad&gt;Erin</span> victory is strongest and is locked.&nbsp; <span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave</span>
is the next to be locked.&nbsp; <span class="cand">Dave&gt;Brad</span> is the next-strongest victory, but it&rsquo;s
skipped since it would contradict <span class="cand">Brad&gt;Erin</span> and <span class="cand">Erin&gt;Dave</span>
(which imply <span class="cand">Brad&gt;Dave</span>).&nbsp; The other victories can all be locked in order, generating
the ordering <span class="cand">Brad&gt;Abby&gt;Erin&gt;Dave&gt;Cora</span>; Tideman would pick
<span class="cand">Brad</span> as the winner since he has locked defeats against all other candidates.&nbsp; Note that
Copeland, Schulze and Tideman find <span class="cand">Cora</span> to be the worst candidate, but Dodgson and Simpson pick
<span class="cand">Cora</span> as the winner.&nbsp; (Dodgson and Simpson very rarely choose a Condorcet loser, as in this
example, but Copeland, Schulze and Tideman never do.)
</p><hr><p>
Unavoidably, these methods will sometimes be unable to choose only one candidate.&nbsp; For example, given the election
</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">25:Ryan&gt;Sara&gt;Todd</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">25:Ryan&gt;Todd&gt;Sara</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">25:Sara&gt;Ryan&gt;Todd</span></td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td><span class="cand">25:Sara&gt;Todd&gt;Ryan</span></td></tr>
</table><p>
no unbiased method would be able to choose one candidate decisively.&nbsp; A tiebreaking ranking must be used to decide
between <span class="cand">Ryan</span> and <span class="cand">Sara</span>.&nbsp; A ballot can be chosen randomly to
provide the tiebreaking ranking.&nbsp; The methods vary widely in their decisiveness and thus in their reliance on
tiebreakers:&nbsp; Black is the most decisive, whereas Copeland is the least, having to rely on a tiebreaker much more
frequently.
</p><p>
Three more procedures, <strong><a name="smith">Smith</a></strong>, <strong><a name="schwartz">Schwartz</a></strong> and
<strong><a name="landau">Landau</a></strong>, are so indecisive that they&rsquo;re usually thought of as producing sets
of candidates rather than winners. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
